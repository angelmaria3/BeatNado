<APP NAME>

Snake Alarm is a gamified alarm clock app where you must play Snake to stop the alarm. No more endless snoozing—the only way to silence it is by winning the game. Along the way, the Snake eats weather icons that not only show the current weather but also trigger musical notes, making every morning a unique combination of fun, weather, and sound.

🔑 How the App Works (Step-by-Step)

Alarm Setup

User sets an alarm just like in any normal alarm app.

Optionally, they can adjust the difficulty:

Easy: Small target score to stop the alarm.

Normal: Moderate target score.

Hard: High target score (perfect for heavy sleepers).

User can enable “Music Mode” (notes triggered per icon eaten).

Alarm Rings

At the set time, the alarm starts ringing with a default or user-chosen tone.

Unlike normal alarms, there is no snooze button—instead, a “Play Snake” button appears.

Snake Challenge

The game launches instantly.

Snake starts moving, and the goal is to eat enough weather icons to reach the target score.

The weather icons represent the current real-world weather (pulled from the API):

☀ Sunny → Yellow sun icons

🌧 Rainy → Blue raindrop icons

❄ Snowy → White snowflake icons

🌩 Stormy → Lightning bolt icons

Icons appear randomly across the grid, but the type of icon depends on today’s weather.

Music Twist

Every icon eaten plays a note or sound effect.

For example:

Sun (☀) → Bright chime note

Rain (🌧) → Soft water drop sound

Snow (❄) → Gentle bell tone

Thunder (🌩) → Drum or bass beat

As the snake keeps eating, these notes form a melody—so every wake-up session generates a tiny piece of music.

Alarm Stops

Once the target score is reached, the alarm stops.

If the player crashes into themselves or the wall, the alarm keeps ringing until they try again.

Result: You’re fully awake, both mentally and physically!
